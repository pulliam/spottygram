# Spottygram

## User Stories
* A mix between a Doggies Instagram and "Doggies" version of Humans of New York. This app's intention is to be a free open place where anyone can post a picture of a Dog's spotting and that will automatically be saved to the page. Those are going to be called posts and they are open to receive anyone's comments and likes on it.
